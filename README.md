# 🔐 Internal Security Audit Project

### 📘 Overview  
This project showcases a **mock internal security audit** conducted as part of the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**.  
The audit evaluates internal controls, data protection, encryption practices, and compliance with frameworks such as **NIST CSF, PCI DSS, SOC, and GDPR**.

---

### 🎯 Objectives  
- Evaluate organizational security posture through an internal audit  
- Assess compliance with security frameworks and best practices  
- Identify gaps in access control, encryption, and disaster recovery  
- Recommend improvements to strengthen information security and business continuity

### 🧠 Key Controls Assessed  
| Control Area | Status | Summary |
|---------------|---------|----------|
| Least Privilege | ❌ Not enforced | All employees have access to customer data |
| Disaster Recovery | ❌ Missing | No recovery plan implemented |
| Password Policy | ⚠️ Weak | Minimal requirements allow potential compromise |
| IDS/IPS | ❌ Absent | No system in place to detect intrusions |
| Backups | ⚠️ Partial | Backups not automated or tested |
| Encryption | ❌ Missing | Sensitive data not encrypted |
| Antivirus | ✅ Implemented | Installed and monitored by IT department |
| Data Integrity | ✅ In place | IT ensures consistency and validation |

   - Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

2. **Data Protection & Encryption**  
   - Encrypt all sensitive data (PII/SPII, payment info)  
   - Use SSL/TLS for data in transit  
   - Introduce tokenization for PCI DSS compliance  

3. **Backup & Disaster Recovery**  
   - Implement daily incremental and weekly full backups  
   - Use cloud-based storage (Azure Backup or AWS Glacier)  
   - Test restoration quarterly to verify integrity  

4. **Monitoring & Threat Detection**  
   - Deploy IDS/IPS and centralized logging (SIEM)  
   - Perform regular vulnerability assessments  

5. **Policy & Governance**  
   - Develop and enforce clear security policies  
   - Conduct ongoing employee security awareness training
